## Guidance

## <img src="docs/images/readme/business_scenario.png" width="48">[Migration Scenario](#migration-scenario)

A DevOps engineer at a multi-cloud enterprise manages Kubernetes workloads across GKE, EKS, and needs to migrate critical applications to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) following company cloud consolidation strategy.

The engineer has dozens of complex Kubernetes configurations with intricate networking, storage, and security requirements. Manual migration analysis would take weeks and risk configuration errors that could impact production workloads.

Using the Migration Solution Accelerator, the complete processing flow works as follows:

### **Enterprise Batch Processing Architecture**

1. **Upload via Web Application**: Engineer uploads Kubernetes configuration files through the React-based Migration Web Application
2. **Automated File Inspection**: Web application performs comprehensive validation:
   - File format and content-type verification
   - YAML syntax validation
   - Platform consistency checks (prevents GKE/EKS mixing)
3. **Queue Generation**: After successful inspection, the system generates processing jobs with unique identifiers and submits them to Azure Storage Queue
4. **Migration Processor Activation**: The multi-agent migration processor (this solution) monitors the queue, picks up processing jobs, and begins intelligent analysis

>  ⚠️ **Important Note on Processing**: This is a **synchronous system**. Users can upload either a single file or multiple files for processing, but only one migration batch runs at a time. Once a batch has started, users must wait for it to complete before the next upload begins. If additional files are uploaded while a migration is in progress, they will automatically queue and start only after the current batch finishes.

### **AI-Powered Migration Process**

Once the migration processor receives a queue message, expert AI agents automatically:

1. **Platform Detection**: Identify whether configurations are from GKE or EKS based on analyzed content
2. **Multi-Expert Analysis**: Technical Architect analyzes overall architecture, while platform-specific experts (GKE/EKS) identify migration challenges and Azure Expert applies Well-Architected Framework principles
3. **Quality Validation**: QA Engineer validates transformation logic and identifies potential issues
4. **YAML Transformation**: Expert YAML agent converts configurations with security, networking, and storage optimizations
5. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Generate detailed migration reports capturing all expert insights and transformation decisions

### **Loosely Coupled & API-Driven Architecture**

The solution provides enterprise-grade capabilities:

- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple migration projects simultaneously through queue-based processing
- **API Integration**: External systems can leverage the migration engine through programmatic queue submission
- **Scalable Processing**: Independent scaling of web interface and processing engine components
- **Fault Tolerance**: Queue-based architecture ensures reliable processing with retry capabilities

Thanks to this enterprise batch processing architecture and AI-powered multi-agent orchestration, migrations that previously took weeks are completed in hours with higher accuracy, comprehensive documentation, and full audit trails.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This solution uses Azure OpenAI o3 reasoning model for advanced reasoning. The model is available across 20+ Azure regions globally. Registration may be required for certain models. Sample configurations in this repository are for demonstration purposes.
